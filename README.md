# notion_task

## Description
Given a csv file with a file containing a table with three rows: book name, member name, and book rating, this program will update a Notion database with one row for each book that got at least one rating. Each row in the database will have:

- Book name (normalized for extra whitespace and capitalization)
- Average rating from all members
- Number of members who rated the book 5 stars - which we call favoriting

## Usage
Run the following command line:
```
python3 main.py ratings.csv
```
where the first argument is the csv file what you would like to read.
